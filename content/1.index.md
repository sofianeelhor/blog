The Infosec Hangout
#description
Hi, I’m 22sh (Sofiane. E), 21 yo student interested in learning about web hacking and penetration testing, though I'm just a skid, sometimes I also try my hand at bug bounty programs. I also play CTF with [Hexagon](https://hexag0n.fr/). I’m currently working on my undergraduate degree and decided to start this blog to share my discoveries with all kinds of write-ups.

In terms of certifications, I am currently [OSEP](https://www.offsec.com/courses/pen-300/) certified. I've also completed [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com/) ProLabs: [Offshore](**url**) and [Zephyr](**url**).

As a fervent Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu enthusiast boasting a blue belt, I revel in the mental and physical puzzles the sport unfolds. My thirst of learning extends beyond the mat.
I continually sharpen my digital prowess on platforms like [HackTheBox](https://app.hackthebox.com/profile/143207) (clinching the #1 place in the France ranking), [Root-Me](https://www.root-me.org/22sh), and [Ringzer0](https://ringzer0ctf.com/profile/42677/22sh).

Huge shoutout to the [HideAndSec](https://hideandsec.sh/) family. A crazy sharing of knowledge I owe them a lot.
